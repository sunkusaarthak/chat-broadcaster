# Console Chat Streamer

Console Chat Streamer is a real-time chat broadcasting application. It allows an admin to create a chat room and multiple listeners to join the room using a unique Room ID. The chat can be accessed either through a web-based UI or by running the provided Python client script.

## Features

- **Admin Room Creation**: Admins can create a unique chat room with a Room ID.
- **Join Room**: Listeners can join an existing chat room using the Room ID.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are broadcasted in real-time to all participants in the room.
- **Web-Based UI**: Users can create or join rooms via a user-friendly web interface.
- **Command-Line Client**: Users can also interact with the chat system using the `client_script.py`.
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Periodic heartbeat messages are sent to ensure active connections.

## Key Components

### Flask Server (`app.py`)
- Handles HTTP routes for the web-based UI.
- Manages WebSocket connections using Socket.IO.
- Supports real-time message broadcasting between Admin and Listeners.

### Command-Line Client (`client_script.py`)
- Provides a simple CLI for creating and joining chat rooms.
- Uses Socket.IO for real-time communication.

### Web-Based UI
- **Home Page**: Allows users to create or join chat rooms.
- **Admin Page**: Displays the Room ID and a chat box for broadcasting messages.
- **Listener Page**: Displays messages broadcasted by the Admin in real-time.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Room (Admin)

2. Create a room to generate a unique Room ID.
3. Share the Room ID with Listeners.

### Joining a Room (Listener)
1. Open the web-based UI or run `client_script.py`.
2. Enter the Room ID to join the chat room.
3. View all messages broadcasted by the Admin.

## Technologies Used
